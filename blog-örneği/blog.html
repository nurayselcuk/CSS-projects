    <h1>Why I Love “Barbenheimer”</h1>

    <h3 class="ff-sans">Barbie and Oppenheimer open on the same weekend, which is great for both films and cinema in general.</h3>

    <p>An unlikely and hilarious “rivalry” is presently playing out on social media between Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer. 
        Both are released on the 21st of July, which in and of itself isn’t remarkable. After all, they are very different 
        films, and it isn’t unusual for studios to schedule counterprogramming on opening weekends, to avoid, say, two 
        superhero films opening at the same time. But despite this, a highly amusing “competition” has developed, stoked by social media users.</p>
    <p>Both are films directed by talented directors of singular vision. Neither film is a sequel. Neither film is a superhero film. 
        This in itself is massively refreshing in mainstream Hollywood summer blockbuster territory. But which will win the battle of the box office?</p>
    <p>In one corner, we have Barbie; a colourful comedy based on the eponymous doll which, according to the marketing, promises to engage those who love and those who hate Barbie. 
        Judging by the trailers, it both celebrates and satirises the titular doll, played by Margot Robbie, with support from Ryan Gosling as Ken. It looks like a lot of 
        fun, and I can imagine even the hardest of sceptics being won over by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zIf0XvoL9Y">this hilarious teaser trailer</a>, 
        which spoofs the opening of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Greta Gerwig has been on my will-watch-everything-she-directs list for some time, consolidating that 
        position with the most recent version of Little Women; my favourite film of 2019. Therefore, Barbie has lots of promise.</p>
